This repo contains the basic code for creating a Faye server using private_pub in order to create an instant group chat feature in Rails.

It is a partner to the [Romp repo](https://github.com/eaud/BookItList) which contains the main code for this application, and the majority of the instructions for deploying this app. 

In order to move into production, hosting this Faye server separately from the main application is a must! Please read this blog for more information: http://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/deploying-private-pub-on-heroku/
